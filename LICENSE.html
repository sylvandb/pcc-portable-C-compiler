<p>The code has a variety of BSD-style licenses. The following are the licenses included in the code.</p>

<p>In regards to the Caldera licensing, read <a href="http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2002/02/28/caldera.html">Why Caldera Released Unix: A Brief History</a>
and their ``Dear UNIX enthusiasts'' letter in <a href="http://www.tsfr.org/~orc/Caldera-License.html">HTML</a> or <a href="http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Caldera-license.pdf">PDF</a> format. See the <a href="../pcc_history/">PCC History</a> page for other details.</p>

<p>To keep the license flora on a reasonable level, it is recommended that new code uses a traditional 2-clause (or less) BSD license.</p>
